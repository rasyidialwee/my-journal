I've been in this industry for almost 10 years now. Ten years as a full-stack developer, and I've just started my journey as a Solution Architect. That's a long time—long enough to accumulate experiences, lessons learned, and countless moments where I thought, "I wish someone had told me this earlier."

I've always loved teaching. There's something deeply satisfying about sharing knowledge, especially when it comes to writing good quality code. Long ago, I used to create classes as a part-time gig, not just for the extra income, but for that genuine satisfaction that comes from seeing someone understand a concept or solve a problem they've been struggling with.

But life gets busy. Responsibilities pile up. The part-time teaching had to take a backseat, and I found myself missing that connection—that opportunity to share what I've learned with others who might benefit from it.

So I challenged myself: if I can't teach in a classroom setting anymore, why not share through writing? A blog seemed like the perfect solution. I could write when I had time, share my experiences, and hopefully help someone else avoid the mistakes I've made or learn from the solutions I've discovered.

My first instinct was WordPress. It's the most popular blogging platform, right? But as I started setting it up, I realized it was overkill for what I needed. A full database, PHP runtime, plugins, themes—all of that infrastructure just to write and publish articles? It felt too heavy for a simple blog.

Plus, there was another consideration: most of my articles are already written in **Markdown**. I write in Markdown for documentation, notes, and technical content. Why should I have to convert everything or use a WYSIWYG editor when I could work with what I already know and love?

So I dove into Google and Reddit, searching for static site generators that could work with Markdown. That's when I found **Hugo**.

Hugo was perfect: fast static site generation, native Markdown support, no database required, simple and clean, and developer-friendly. It felt like it was made for developers like me who want to write without the overhead of a traditional CMS.

I run Hugo and Nginx on my homelab server, which is powered by **TrueNAS SCALE**. There's something satisfying about self-hosting your own blog—full control, no vendor lock-in, and the ability to customize everything exactly how you want it. *(I'll share more about my homelab journey and setup in another article—there's a whole story there about building a personal infrastructure that's both powerful and educational.)*

This blog isn't just about sharing code snippets or tutorials. It's about documenting my journey from a full-stack developer to a Solution Architect. It's about the lessons learned, the mistakes made, and the insights gained along the way. It's my journal of growth in this industry.

If you're reading this, welcome. I hope you find something useful here, whether you're just starting out or navigating your own career transition. Let's learn together.
