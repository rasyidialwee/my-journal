Well-designed APIs are intuitive, consistent, and easy to use. Following best practices makes your APIs more maintainable.

## RESTful Principles

- Use proper HTTP methods
- Follow REST conventions
- Use meaningful URLs
- Return appropriate status codes

## Documentation

Good API documentation is essential. Use tools like Swagger or OpenAPI to generate interactive documentation.

## Versioning

Version your APIs to allow for changes without breaking existing clients. Use URL versioning or header-based versioning.
