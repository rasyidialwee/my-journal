React Hooks revolutionized the way we write React components. They allow us to use state and other React features in functional components.

## What are Hooks?

Hooks are functions that let you "hook into" React state and lifecycle features from function components. They were introduced in React 16.8.

## Common Hooks

- useState
- useEffect
- useContext
- useReducer

## Best Practices

Always use hooks at the top level of your component, and never call them inside loops, conditions, or nested functions.
