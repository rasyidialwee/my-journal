Responsive design ensures your website looks great on all devices, from mobile phones to desktop computers.

## Media Queries

Media queries allow you to apply CSS styles based on device characteristics like screen width, height, and orientation.

## Flexible Layouts

- Use relative units (em, rem, %)
- Implement flexible grids
- Use CSS Grid and Flexbox
- Optimize images for different screens

## Mobile-First Approach

Start designing for mobile devices first, then enhance the experience for larger screens. This approach ensures better performance.
