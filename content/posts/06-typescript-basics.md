TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. It adds static type definitions to JavaScript.

## Why TypeScript?

TypeScript helps catch errors early in development, provides better IDE support, and makes code more maintainable.

## Basic Types

- string
- number
- boolean
- array
- object

## Getting Started

Start by adding type annotations to your JavaScript code, then gradually adopt more advanced TypeScript features.
